# Separator

A hairline. Dividers come last (R5.8): use space, then grouping, and only then this — and
only between action groups in a toolbar or menu, as table row lines, or as a scroll edge.

`import { Separator } from "glass-ux/separator"`

| ref | `Ref<HTMLDivElement> \| undefined` | See type | no | — | Allows getting a ref to the component instance. Once the component unmounts, React will set `ref.current` to `null` (or call the ref with `null` if you passed a callback ref). |

Accepts a `ReactElement` or a function that returns the element to render. |
| style | `React.CSSProperties \| ((state: import("@base-ui/react").SeparatorState) => React.CSSProperties \| undefined) \| undefined` | See type | no | — | Style applied to the element, or a function that returns a style object based on the component's state. |
