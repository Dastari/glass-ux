# SearchField

Search box: magnifier, clear button while filled, Esc clears, optional ⌘K hint for the
top bar. Filtering lists, tables and the command palette all use this one field.

`import { SearchField } from "glass-ux/input"`

## Props

| Prop | Type | Valid options | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| aria-label | `string \| undefined` | See type | no | — | Accessible name when no visible label is present. |
| className | `string \| undefined` | See type | no | — | Layout only (width, grid placement). Applied to the control box. |
| invalid | `boolean \| undefined` | false, true | no | — | Invalid outside a Field (inside a Field, set `error` on the Field instead). |
| onClear | `(() => void) \| undefined` | See type | no | — | Called after the clear button or Escape empties the field. |
| onRevealedChange | `((revealed: boolean) => void) \| undefined` | See type | no | — | Called with the new state when the show/hide password button is pressed. Pair with `revealed` to control it. |
| ref | `Ref<HTMLInputElement> \| undefined` | See type | no | — | Receives the underlying element for focus or measurement. React 19 accepts ref as a normal prop. |
| revealed | `boolean \| undefined` | false, true | no | — | Password boxes: whether the value shows as text. Leave unset for the box's own toggle. |
| shortcut | `string \| undefined` | See type | no | — | Keyboard hint shown while the field is empty and unfocused ("mod+k" → ⌘K / Ctrl K). |
| size | `InputSize \| undefined` | "sm", "md", "lg" | no | — | The token-based size. Touch targets adapt to coarse pointers independently of the selected density. |
| trailing | `ReactNode` | See type | no | — | Any other trailing content (a status, a small action). |
| unit | `ReactNode` | See type | no | — | Unit after the value ("GB", "ms", "%"). |
| width | `FieldWidth \| undefined` | "full", "short", "medium" | no | — | Content width: short (port, PIN), medium (name, hostname), full (default). |

Standard React DOM attributes and events are accepted wherever the component extends a native element. The online API page lists those inherited properties as well.
