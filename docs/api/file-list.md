# FileList

The list under a FileDrop. Rows have a fixed height, so progress never moves them.

`import { FileList } from "glass-ux/file-drop"`

| defaultValue | `string \| number \| readonly string[] \| undefined` | See type | no | — | The initial value when using the component without controlling its state. |
| ref | `Ref<HTMLUListElement> \| undefined` | See type | no | — | Allows getting a ref to the component instance. Once the component unmounts, React will set `ref.current` to `null` (or call the ref with `null` if you passed a callback ref). |
